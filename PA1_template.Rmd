Load and analyze activity data, per assignment.

First, some basic setup:

- Load required libraries
- Set echo = TRUE (per assignment)

```{r setup}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
Read data from activity.csv into **steps**, extracting from ZIP file if necessary:

```{r extract}
files <- list.files()
if (! ("activity.csv" %in% files)) {
    unzip("activity.zip")
}

steps <- read.csv("activity.csv", as.is = TRUE)
steps$interval <- sprintf("%04d", steps$interval)
steps$date     <- as.POSIXlt(steps$date, format="%Y-%m-%d")
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
